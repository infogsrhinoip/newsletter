## Action Group Updates

### [New Process For Newsletter Submission](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/newsletter)

We have a new process for submitting project news! Yay! No more cumbersome spreadsheets! Check out the [README for more details](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/newsletter/blob/master/README.md). We also have a handy [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkrpumELLko&feature=youtu.be) that walks through the process.

### [Project Onboarding Process Improvements](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/projects/1)

Project onboarding is now handled publicly via GitHub issues. The process is now more transparent and visible. Progress through the process is easily visualized via a [GitHub project board](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/projects/1).

This is part of our effort to move to open processes so action groups and community members can more easily participate. The previous process was buried in emails and word documents and lacked visibility and transpancey.

We have an issue template for new project applications here: https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/issues/new/choose

Key goals:

* Clear status to projects
* Use milestones and labels to batch up applications into monthly review cycles
* Enable action group members to review and help out on applications
* Comments / pull requests / etc. are welcome.

### [Migrate ASP.NET Web Forms Sites to .NET Core using DotVVM](https://www.dotvvm.com/blog/59/Modernizing-ASP-NET-Web-Forms-applications-with-DotVVM)

Did you know that DotVVM can be used to incrementally modernize old ASP.NET Web Forms applications and lift them to .NET Core? It is much easier than doing a full rewrite, and the application can be deployed at any time during the entire process. 

* Install DotVVM NuGet package in your Web Forms site
* Create a DotVVM master page using the same CSS
* Start converting ASPX pages to DotHTML syntax, one at a time
* When all the Web Forms pages are gone, change your CSPROJ to use .NET Core

We have created some useful resources that will help you in this process.
