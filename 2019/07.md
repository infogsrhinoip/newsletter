## Action Group Updates

### [New Process For Newsletter Submission](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/newsletter)

We have a new process for submitting project news! Yay! No more cumbersome spreadsheets! Check out the [README for more details](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/newsletter/blob/master/README.md). We also have a handy [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkrpumELLko&feature=youtu.be) that walks through the process.

### [Project Onboarding Process Improvements](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/projects/1)

Project onboarding is now handled publicly via GitHub issues. The process is now more transparent and visible. Progress through the process is easily visualized via a [GitHub project board](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/projects/1).

This is part of our effort to move to open processes so action groups and community members can more easily participate. The previous process was buried in emails and word documents and lacked visibility and transpancey.

We have an issue template for new project applications here: https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/projects/issues/new/choose

Key goals:

* Clear status to projects
* Use milestones and labels to batch up applications into monthly review cycles
* Enable action group members to review and help out on applications
* Comments / pull requests / etc. are welcome.

## .NET Foundation Project Updates

### [ML.NET 1.2 released](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-ml-net-1-2-and-model-builder-updates-machine-learning-for-net/)

ML.NET 1.2 and updates to Model Builder and the CLI were released on early July 2019. ML.NET is an open-source and cross-platform machine learning framework for .NET developers. ML.NET also includes Model Builder (a simple UI tool for Visual Studio) and the ML.NET CLI (Command-line interface) to make it super easy to build custom Machine Learning (ML) models using Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Using ML.NET, developers can leverage their existing tools and skill-sets to develop and infuse custom ML into their applications by creating custom machine learning models for common scenarios like Sentiment Analysis, Price Prediction, Image Classification and more!

The following are some of the key highlights in this release:

- General availability of TimeSeries support for forecasting and anomaly detection
- General availability of ML.NET packages to use TensorFlow and ONNX models
- Easily integrate ML.NET models in web or serverless apps with Microsoft.Extensions.ML integration package
- MLNET CLI and Model Builder for Visual Studio were updated with multiple improvements

For further details on the ML.NET 1.2 release, check this Blog Post:

### [Cake v0.34.0 released](https://cakebuild.net/blog/2019/07/cake-v0.34.0-released) & [v0.34.1 released](https://cakebuild.net/blog/2019/07/cake-v0.34.1-released)  ![Cake logo](https://cakebuild.net/assets/img/logo.png)

Version 0.34.0 has several features, improvements and bug fixes, full details in the linked blog post but a few highlights in this release:

* Improved MSBuild 16 (VS2019) tool resolution
* Update to Roslyn version 3.0.0
* Updated to NuGet client version 5
* NuGet pack support for several new nuspec elements

Version 0.34.1 is just a minor release as a hotfix to address an issue breaking scripts when the dynamic C# keyword was used in build scripts. This was a side effect of updating from Roslyn 2.x to 3.x. 

üéâ We're also happy to share that Cake turned five years old this May! And we've just done our 100th Cake release! üéâ <br/>
Huge thanks to our contributors and users! Wouldn't have been possible without your support! ‚ù§

### [Migrate ASP.NET Web Forms Sites to .NET Core using DotVVM](https://www.dotvvm.com/blog/59/Modernizing-ASP-NET-Web-Forms-applications-with-DotVVM)

Did you know that DotVVM can be used to incrementally modernize old ASP.NET Web Forms applications and lift them to .NET Core? It is much easier than doing a full rewrite, and the application can be deployed at any time during the entire process. 

* Install DotVVM NuGet package in your Web Forms site
* Create a DotVVM master page using the same CSS
* Start converting ASPX pages to DotHTML syntax, one at a time
* When all the Web Forms pages are gone, change your CSPROJ to use .NET Core

We have created some useful resources that will help you in this process.

### [Prism v7.2.0.1367 released](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism/releases/tag/v7.2.0.1367)

Prism 7.2 has several improvements for WPF and Xamarin.Forms developers including:

* New Fluent API for the IContainerRegistry
* Added several new API's to IContainerRegistry and IContainerProvider that significantly reduce the need to depend directly on the root container
* Optimizations for the Weak DelegateReference for the EventAggregator
* Added a new Dialog Service allowing developers to create dialogs in their app with a more custom look and feel

Additionally Xamarin.Forms developers will be able to enjoy:

* New initialization API's including IInitialize, IInitializeAsync & IAutoInitialize. These all help you to replace the now Obsolete `OnNavigatingTo` from INavigatingAware and INavigationAware
* Automatic ViewRegistrion
* Additional XAML Extensions... all XAML Extensions are now fully bindable
* Enhanced Modal logic that should eliminate the need to ever specify whether to use Modal navigation when Navigating back from a page.
* Added extension to allow selecting tabs from the NavigationService
