### [.NET Conf 2019](https://www.dotnetconf.net)

It's a wrap on .NET Conf 2019 (September 23 - 25) and it was the largest one yet! I don't have the exact numbers available, but Javier Lozano, one of the founders of the conference assures me it was significantly larger in attendance than last year. 

For those who don't know, .NET Conf is a virtual conference with speakers from all over the planet. If you missed it, [__all the sessions are available on Youtube!__](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLReL099Y5nRd04p81Q7p5TtyjCrj9tz1t)

During the conference, the .NET Foundation announced a proposal to develop a Project Maturity Model, which leads to the next update.

### Rethinking the Project Maturity Model

The .NET Foundation Board engaged with the community and received a ton of feedback both positive, neutral, and negative regarding the proposal. The feedback helped us realize that we made a mistake in our approach and need to scrap the proposal and rethink the approach. [Find out more in this blog post](https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2019/09/30/rethinking-project-maturity-as-a-community-process) by Ben Adams, a .NET Foundation board member.

And a big thank you to everyone who commented on the proposal! Your feedback is valuable.

### .NET Core 3.0 Released

One of the highlights of .NET Conf was the release of .NET Core 3.0. Find out [what's new in 3.0 here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-core-3-0). This is a major release bump so there will be breaking changes. Even so, I for one am looking forward to upgrading my code to reap [all the performance benefits](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-core-3-0/).

It's an exciting time to be a .NET developer!

## Action Group Updates

### Survey

A survey went out to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GlennCoder/status/1178140797255897089) about a recent proposal of the .NET Foundation Board.

The survey was closed early, but had 280 participants in total.

## Events

## .NET Foundation Project Updates

### [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly)

[Polly version 7.1.1](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#711) released: bug fix for async retries with `.ConfigureAwait(true)`

The Polly-Contrib community continues to grow, with two new releases:

+ **Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry** ([github](https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry); [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry)): provides a new jitter strategy for decorrelating retries in highly concurrent scenarios, as well as a range of helper methods for common wait-and-retry scenarios such as exponential backoff.  The new jitter strategy offers a smoother distribution (stronger decorrelation) than previous jitter recommendations, combined with a well-defined exponential backoff characteristic. Thanks to [@george-polevoy](https://github.com/george-polevoy), [@grant-d](https://github.com/grant-d) and [@hyrmn](https://github.com/hyrmn) for making this project a reality!

+ **[Polly.Contrib.AzureFunctions.CircuitBreaker](https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.AzureFunctions.CircuitBreaker)**: is a durable, distributed circuit-breaker, implemented in the new [Azure Entity Functions (preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-entities).  The distributed circuit-breaker can be consumed from within plain Azure functions and Azure orchestration functions, and is fully stateful and consistent across function invocations and function app scale-out.  The circuit-breaker also exposes an external Http api, making it consumable as a general distributed circuit-breaker for apps or components outside functions. Authored by the [core Polly team](https://github.com/reisenberger).

### [Windows Community Toolkit](https://aka.ms/wct)

[Announced preview of XAML controls for Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/blogs/announcing-xaml-controls-for-microsoft-graph-in-the-windows-community-toolkit/#.XYO6zQJlygk.twitter) which work with UWP apps and in WPF/WinForms for Win32 apps via XAML Islands on .NET Core 3 and on Android and iOS with [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno)! [GitHub repo for control preview](https://aka.ms/wgt).

6.0 Release coming in October, [see the release plan here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/issues/2989).

### [ReactiveUI](https://reactiveui.net)

[Version 10](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/releases/tag/10.0.1) of ReactiveUI that added .NET Core 3.0 WPF/Winforms and Blazor preview support. The release also offered a bunch of performance upgrades converting from Tuple to ValueTuple, and using non-reflection based Observables.

We are working on changing the way the Initialization is done within ReactiveUI v11 to make it more obvious to users how it is performed and remove reflection.

### IdentityServer 3.0 released - and now part of the ASP.NET Core 3 templates
IdentityServer4 3.0 is now compatible with ASP.NET Core 3. The focus of this release was mostly to make sure everything is working with the new ASP.NET Core version, but also adds a couple of new features:

* Adding the last missing pieces for [FAPI](https://openid.net/wg/fapi/) compliance
   * support for the PS* and ES* family of signing algorithms
   * support for `s_hash` claim
* Update to use the latest [IdentityModel](https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel) version

IdentityServer4 is also now included in the new Angular and React templates in Visual Studio. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity-api-authorization) for documenation.

### [DotVVM 2.4 Preview 1 with .NET Core 3.0 Support](https://www.dotvvm.com/blog/63/DotVVM-2-4-0-preview01-with-support-for-NET-Core-3-0)

[DotVVM 2.4](https://www.dotvvm.com/blog/63/DotVVM-2-4-0-preview01-with-support-for-NET-Core-3-0) brings several important improvements and fixes, and is fully compatible with ASP.NET Core 3.0.

* Better PWA (Progressive Web App) support in DotVVM
* Diagnostics and debugging improvements
* Performance improvements of the ValidationSummary control
* New MultiSelect control
* and more...

And we've created a new sample app - [Blazing Pizza rewritten into DotVVM](https://github.com/riganti/dotvvm-samples-blazingpizza) - it shows the differences between Razor syntax and the MVVM approach used in DotVVM.

### [Cake](https://github.com/cake-build/cake)

[Cake 0.35.0 version](https://cakebuild.net/blog/2019/09/cake-v0.35.0-released)

We're really excited by this release which has several features and improvements:

* .NET Core 3 support
* C# 8 support
* Runtime identification improvements
* Runtime compiler constants
* and more...

Full details in [Cake v0.35.0 released](https://cakebuild.net/blog/2019/09/cake-v0.35.0-released) blog post.
