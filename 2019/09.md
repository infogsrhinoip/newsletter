### IdentityServer 3.0 released - and now part of the ASP.NET Core 3 templates
IdentityServer4 3.0 is now compatible with ASP.NET Core 3. The focus of this release was mostly to make sure everything is working with the new ASP.NET Core version, but also adds a couple of new features:

* Adding the last missing pieces for [FAPI](https://openid.net/wg/fapi/) compliance
   * support for the PS* and ES* family of signing algorithms
   * support for `s_hash` claim
* Update to use the latest [IdentityModel](https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel) version

IdentityServer4 is also now included in the new Angular and React templates in Visual Studio. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity-api-authorization) for documenation.
