### [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly)

[Polly version 7.1.1](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#711) released: bug fix for async retries with `.ConfigureAwait(true)`

The Polly-Contrib community continues to grow, with two new releases:

+ **Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry** ([github](https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry); [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry)): provides a new jitter strategy for decorrelating retries in highly concurrent scenarios, as well as a range of helper methods for common wait-and-retry scenarios such as exponential backoff.  The new jitter strategy offers a smoother distribution (stronger decorrelation) than previous jitter recommendations, combined with a well-defined exponential backoff characteristic. Thanks to [@george-polevoy](https://github.com/george-polevoy), [@grant-d](https://github.com/grant-d) and [@hyrmn](https://github.com/hyrmn) for making this project a reality!

+ **[Polly.Contrib.AzureFunctions.CircuitBreaker](https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.AzureFunctions.CircuitBreaker)**: is a durable, distributed circuit-breaker, implemented in the new [Azure Entity Functions (preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-entities).  The distributed circuit-breaker can be consumed from within plain Azure functions and Azure orchestration functions, and is fully stateful and consistent across function invocations and function app scale-out.  The circuit-breaker also exposes an external Http api, making it consumable as a general distributed circuit-breaker for apps or components outside functions. Authored by the [core Polly team](https://github.com/reisenberger).

### [Windows Community Toolkit](https://aka.ms/wct)

[Announced preview of XAML controls for Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/blogs/announcing-xaml-controls-for-microsoft-graph-in-the-windows-community-toolkit/#.XYO6zQJlygk.twitter) which work with UWP apps and in WPF/WinForms for Win32 apps via XAML Islands on .NET Core 3 and on Android and iOS with [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno)! [GitHub repo for control preview](https://aka.ms/wgt).

6.0 Release coming in October, [see the release plan here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/issues/2989).

### [ReactiveUI](https://reactiveui.net)

[Version 10](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/releases/tag/10.0.1) of ReactiveUI that added .NET Core 3.0 WPF/Winforms and Blazor preview support. The release also offered a bunch of performance upgrades converting from Tuple to ValueTuple, and using non-reflection based Observables.

We are working on changing the way the Initialization is done within ReactiveUI v11 to make it more obvious to users how it is performed and remove reflection.

### IdentityServer 3.0 released - and now part of the ASP.NET Core 3 templates
IdentityServer4 3.0 is now compatible with ASP.NET Core 3. The focus of this release was mostly to make sure everything is working with the new ASP.NET Core version, but also adds a couple of new features:

* Adding the last missing pieces for [FAPI](https://openid.net/wg/fapi/) compliance
   * support for the PS* and ES* family of signing algorithms
   * support for `s_hash` claim
* Update to use the latest [IdentityModel](https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel) version

IdentityServer4 is also now included in the new Angular and React templates in Visual Studio. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity-api-authorization) for documenation.

### [DotVVM 2.4 Preview 1 with .NET Core 3.0 Support](https://www.dotvvm.com/blog/63/DotVVM-2-4-0-preview01-with-support-for-NET-Core-3-0)

[DotVVM 2.4](https://www.dotvvm.com/blog/63/DotVVM-2-4-0-preview01-with-support-for-NET-Core-3-0) brings several important improvements and fixes, and is fully compatible with ASP.NET Core 3.0.

* Better PWA (Progressive Web App) support in DotVVM

And we've created a new sample app - [Blazing Pizza rewritten into DotVVM](https://github.com/riganti/dotvvm-samples-blazingpizza) - it shows the differences between Razor syntax and the MVVM approach used in DotVVM.

### [Cake](https://github.com/cake-build/cake)
