### [ReactiveUI](https://reactiveui.net)

[Version 10](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/releases/tag/10.0.1) of ReactiveUI that added .NET Core 3.0 WPF/Winforms and Blazor preview support. The release also offered a bunch of performance upgrades converting from Tuple to ValueTuple, and using non-reflection based Observables.

We are working on changing the way the Initialization is done within ReactiveUI v11 to make it more obvious to users how it is performed and remove reflection.
