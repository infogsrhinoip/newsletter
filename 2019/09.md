### [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly)

[Polly version 7.1.1](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#711) released: bug fix for async retries with `.ConfigureAwait(true)`

The Polly-Contrib community continues to grow, with two new releases:

+ **Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry** ([github](https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry); [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry)): provides a new jitter strategy for decorrelating retries in highly concurrent scenarios, as well as a range of helper methods for common wait-and-retry scenarios such as exponential backoff.  The new jitter strategy offers a smoother distribution (stronger decorrelation) than previous jitter recommendations, combined with a well-defined exponential backoff characteristic. Thanks to [@george-polevoy](https://github.com/george-polevoy), [@grant-d](https://github.com/grant-d) and [@hyrmn](https://github.com/hyrmn) for making this project a reality!

+ **[Polly.Contrib.AzureFunctions.CircuitBreaker](https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.AzureFunctions.CircuitBreaker)**: is a durable, distributed circuit-breaker, implemented in the new [Azure Entity Functions (preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-entities).  The distributed circuit-breaker can be consumed from within plain Azure functions and Azure orchestration functions, and is fully stateful and consistent across function invocations and function app scale-out.  The circuit-breaker also exposes an external Http api, making it consumable as a general distributed circuit-breaker for apps or components outside functions. Authored by the [core Polly team](https://github.com/reisenberger).

### [BaGet](https://github.com/loic-sharma/BaGet)

[BaGet version 0.2.0-preview1](https://github.com/loic-sharma/BaGet/releases/tag/v0.2.0-preview1) was released. This adds [`BaGet.Protocol`](https://github.com/loic-sharma/BaGet/tree/master/src/BaGet.Protocol#bagetprotocol), an easy-to-use SDK to interact with NuGet V3 servers. For more information, see:
