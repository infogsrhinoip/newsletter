## .NET Foundation Project Updates
### IdentityModel v4 is released

IdentityModel has been growing organically over the last years, and we felt it is necessary to do some fundamental cleanup. At the same time it is used by a lot of people and companies (currently around 20 million downloads on nuget) – which is a bit scary when doing breaking changes.

But since we are at a point where a new .NET Core runtime is released, and thus many other libraries will release new major version, we thought that this might be a good opportunity to make the changes.

**This version is a breaking release!!!**

Stay on v3.x if you are using:

* IdentityServer4 v2.x
* IdentityServer4.AccessTokenValidation v2.x
* IdentityModel.AspNetCore.OAuth2Introspection v3.x
* IdentityModel.OidcClient v2.x

All subsequent major versions of the above mentioned packages have switched to IdentityModel v4 and will be released along with IdentityServer4 v3 on the 23rd September.

In the coming days I will push IdentityModel v4 to nuget – here’s a high level list of the changes.

**Target frameworks**
I dropped the net452 target – v4 is targeting net461 and netstandard2.0 only.

**Removed old `*Client` classes**
I removed the protocol client classes like `TokenClient` in favour of the newer style extension methods for HttpMessageInvoker (the base class of HttpClient). This allows you to manage the setup and lifetime of the HTTP client yourself.
I added a new `TokenClient` and `IntrospectionClient` based on the new design which is now DI and `HttpClientFactory` friendly. I did that mainly because I needed them in some other project. Give them a try, and see if they work for you as well.

**Removed access token related delegating handlers for `HttpClient`**
I never was happy with their design, and they also did not work for some common scenarios. Part of the work has been moved to [OidcClient](https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel.OidcClient2) (for native apps) and part of it has been moved to the [ASP.NET Core specific IdentityModel](https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel.AspNetCore).

**Updated extension methods**
The protocol extensions methods have been re-written from the ground up. The public API surface stayed mostly the same, but certain classes have been renamed for clarity.
The request objects now derive from `HttpRequestMessage` which gives you more control over the HTTP details (e.g. headers).

**Updated Epoch Extensions**
Year 2038 is coming! All extensions have been updated to use long instead of int. Alternatively – .NET has built-in support now as well. So feel free to switch to that if you like.

**Misc**
I probably changed some parameter, classes and namespace names..

### [Chemistry Add-In for Word (Chem4Word)](https://www.chem4word.co.uk/)

It seems like it's all gone quiet on Chem4Word recently, but we've been working _extremely_ hard on addressing some licensing concerns.  _Chem4Word_ is currently released under the Apache 2.0 license, but its structure 'sketcher' is a 3rd-party product which uses GPL. We've muddled through up to now because the editor is dyamically linked. But we'd also really like to get our entire code base under the .NET Foundation umbrella.

So we've been writing a new sketcher - the _Advanced CML-based Molecule Editor_ (or ACME for short).  It's written in C# and uses Windows Presentation Foundation for its graphics.  It can be used as a drop-in structure editor for any Windows Forms or WPF application.

 ![ACME in Action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10074162/62897078-5f8fcd00-bd4a-11e9-8068-e153788e579f.png)

Having our own editor also means we have _complete control_ over what we can and can't edit in CML.  This means we can add new features much more easily.  And keep our users happy!

We should soon have ACME ready for beta-testing.  The team members who have worked incredibly hard on this are:
- Joe Townsend
- Mike Williams
- Andy Wright

 If anyone fancies beta-testing ACME then you can drop me a line (clyde.davies@gmail.com).  All offers of help gratefully received!

### [NUnit 3 Test Adapter 3.15](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Adapter-Release-Notes#nunit3-test-adapter-for-visual-studio---version-315---august-23-2019)

Versions 3.14 and 3.15 were both released this month. Changes include:

- A performance boost when running a fraction of the tests by using a test discovery prefilter (thanks Matthew Beardmore!)
- The working directory is changed to the temp folder when VSTest starts with the current directory inside `C:\Windows` or Program Files.
- `TestContext.Progress` only goes to the console now and not the test output.
- Engine extensions are now loaded by the adapter, enabling scenarios such as mixing NUnit and xUnit tests in the same run (thanks Nikolay Borisenko!)

ℹ NUnit Test Adapter 3.15 has uncovered some less-common bugs in NUnit Framework that must be fixed in a new NUnit Framework release. To preserve compatibility with older versions of NUnit Framework, NUnit Test Adapter 3.15.1 (releasing soon) will make the prefilter opt-in via runsettings.

[NUnit 2 Test Adapter 2.2](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/AdapterV2-Release-Notes#nunit-test-adapter-for-visual-studio---version-220---june-5-2019) was available last month with bugfixes and with a VSIX that supports Visual Studio 2019.

The [NUnit dotnet CLI template 1.6.3](https://github.com/nunit/dotnet-new-nunit/releases/tag/v1.6.3) features dependency updates and an F# template improvement (thanks zanaptak!)

### [Orleans 3.0.0-beta1](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta1)

- Major improvements
  - Replaced networking stack with the Bedrock layer of ASP.NET Core
  - Support for future wire protocol versioning
  - A series of improvements in cluster recovery from node failures
  - Pluggable data adapters for EventHub stream provider
  - Compatibility with .NET Core 3.0

This release is backward compatible, over the wire messaging wise, with 2.* releases, which allows for in-place upgrade of a running cluster. However, there are several breaking changes in the APIs that might require minor adjustments for application code to compile.

We measured significant performance gains with this release over 2.* versions, ranging from 8% to 93% depending on the test, mostly due to the network stack rewrite.

### [Orleans 2.4.0](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v2.4.0) and [2.4.1](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v2.4.1)

- Major improvements 
  - Reduced reliance on cluster membership table and speed up clustering convergence by sending versioned snapshots of the table as part of gossip messages
  - Configurable transactional state roles to support cases when a transactional state cannot be transaction manager

This release is backward compatible with 2.0.* releases, which allows for in-place upgrade of a running cluster.
