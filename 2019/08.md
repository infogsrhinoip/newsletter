## .NET Foundation Project Updates
### [Chemistry Add-In for Word (Chem4Word)](https://www.chem4word.co.uk/)

It seems like it's all gone quiet on Chem4Word recently, but we've been working _extremely_ hard on addressing some licensing concerns.  _Chem4Word_ is currently released under the Apache 2.0 license, but its structure 'sketcher' is a 3rd-party product which uses GPL. We've muddled through up to now because the editor is dyamically linked. But we'd also really like to get our entire code base under the .NET Foundation umbrella.

So we've been writing a new sketcher - the _Advanced CML-based Molecule Editor_ (or ACME for short).  It's written in C# and uses Windows Presentation Foundation for its graphics.  It can be used as a drop-in structure editor for any Windows Forms or WPF application.

 ![ACME in Action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10074162/62897078-5f8fcd00-bd4a-11e9-8068-e153788e579f.png)

Having our own editor also means we have _complete control_ over what we can and can't edit in CML.  This means we can add new features much more easily.  And keep our users happy!

We should soon have ACME ready for beta-testing.  The team members who have worked incredibly hard on this are:
- Joe Townsend
- Mike Williams
- Andy Wright

 If anyone fancies beta-testing ACME then you can drop me a line (clyde.davies@gmail.com).  All offers of help gratefully received!

### [NUnit 3 Test Adapter 3.15](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Adapter-Release-Notes#nunit3-test-adapter-for-visual-studio---version-315---august-23-2019)

Versions 3.14 and 3.15 were both released this month. Changes include:

- A performance boost when running a fraction of the tests by using a test discovery prefilter (thanks Matthew Beardmore!)
- The working directory is changed to the temp folder when VSTest starts with the current directory inside `C:\Windows` or Program Files.
- `TestContext.Progress` only goes to the console now and not the test output.
- Engine extensions are now loaded by the adapter, enabling scenarios such as mixing NUnit and xUnit tests in the same run (thanks Nikolay Borisenko!)

[NUnit 2 Test Adapter 2.2](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/AdapterV2-Release-Notes#nunit-test-adapter-for-visual-studio---version-220---june-5-2019) was available last month with bugfixes and with a VSIX that supports Visual Studio 2019.

The [NUnit dotnet CLI template 1.6.3](https://github.com/nunit/dotnet-new-nunit/releases/tag/v1.6.3) features dependency updates and an F# template improvement (thanks zanaptak!)
