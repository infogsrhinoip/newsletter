Thank you for submitting news for the newsletter.

Foundation/Project news should be submitted as a pull request to the existing newsletter markdown file. Please append your news to the section labeled `.NET Foundation Project Updates`.

It's a simple format.

Start with an H3 heading that is linked to your news item. So if you're writing about a new release, then link the heading to the release. If you're writing about a new project, link to the repository.

Follow the heading with your project news. Feel free to include images and links.

_Pro tip on images_: Go to a [new issue form](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/newsletter/issues/new), then drag and drop an image into the body of the issue. It will upload the image and when it's done, present the markdown for the image. Copy and paste that into your news item. __Don't save the issue!__ The image will remain.

Here's a template you can use.

```md
### [Headline for your news](https://URL-TO-THE-SUBJECT-OF-THE-NEWS)

Write all your content here using Markdown. See the following guide: https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

You might have a nice ![image here](https://URL-TO-IMAGE/).

Sometimes it's nice to end with a:

* [bulletted](url-to-resource)
* [list](url-to-resource)
* [of linked resources](url-to-resource)
```
